# ðŸ§  Neural Network from Scratch â€“ Churn Prediction  

This project implements and compares **three different approaches** to predicting customer churn:  

1. âœ… A **neural network implemented completely from scratch** using only NumPy.  
2. âš¡ A **TensorFlow/Keras-based neural network** as an industry-standard baseline.  
3. ðŸŒ² A **Random Forest classifier** using scikit-learn.  

ðŸš€ **Highlight:**  
The NumPy-based neural network achieves a **test accuracy within 0.001 of the TensorFlow/Keras model**.  
This demonstrates that a carefully implemented scratch model can **match the performance of a modern deep learning framework**, proving both correctness and efficiency of the implementation.  

The goal of the project is to:  
- Show how neural networks work at the lowest level (forward/backward propagation).  
- Compare scratch-built models with library implementations.  
- Provide a clean, reproducible workflow for churn prediction.
